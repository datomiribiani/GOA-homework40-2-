        <h1 style="color: red;">ferari sf90</h1>
        <p style="color: chartreuse; font-size: larger;">The Ferrari SF90 is a high-performance hybrid supercar made by the Italian car manufacturer Ferrari. It was first introduced in 2019 and is one of the most advanced cars Ferrari has ever built.

        The full name of the car is Ferrari SF90 Stradale. "SF90" stands for Scuderia Ferrari 90, celebrating 90 years of Ferrari’s racing team. "Stradale" means "road" in Italian, showing that this car is street-legal even though it has racing-level performance.

        The SF90 has a V8 twin-turbo engine combined with three electric motors, making it a plug-in hybrid. Together, they produce 986 horsepower (735 kW), allowing the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0–62 mph) in just 2.5 seconds.</p>
